## How to use Jupyter Notebooks

The main ["IDE"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) that we will be using this week are Jupyter Notebooks. Jupyter Notebooks is great to try out different code snippets to selectively debug the code you are writing.

Everything in these notebooks resolves around cells. The current active cell has a blue or green stripe on the left side. (The different colors denote different modes which for us is not important. [Look here for more information](https://medium.com/ibm-data-science-experience/back-to-basics-jupyter-notebooks-dfcdc19c54bc)) Normally a cell contains a section of code that is executed together. E.g. We often define each function in their own cell.

Just to go through the basics you can select one of the sections and then click the run button on the top or  hit `shift + return` on your keyboard to execute that particular cell. 


There are two commands you need to remember. The first one is `shift + return`.
