0. If you don't have a Github account, create a Github account.
1. [Fork this git repository to your own GitHub.](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/wiki/Forking-a-GitHub-project) ![Fork](images/HowToFork.png) [More help](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo)
2. Make a folder on your local computer for this workshop, e.g. /Users/LelandJr/NN4A
2. Clone your forked version of the repository to your local computer workshop directory.

## Installing software tools and libraries
Before we can get started, we first have to install a few tools and software libraries.

1. [Install Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).
2. Start Jupyter notebooks in the folder that you cloned your the forked GitHub repository (i.e. in the folder you just downloaded).

We should add an image here.

3. Within Jupyter, navigate to the folder ./00_Setup/ and open the Notebook inside. 
4. Follow the steps inside that notebook to install and test the software libraries we need for this workshop.

## Download datasets

We will be using two audio datasets in the first lab: Cats vs. Dogs and UrbanSounds. To download these datasets, you will need to create accounts on [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com), a data science community site run by Google, which has, among other things, datasets for machine learning, and the Urbansounds dataset website.

[Cats vs. Dogs](http://www.kaggle.com/mmoreaux/audio-cats-and-dogs)

[Urban Sounds](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/download-urbansound.html)

When these datasets are finished downloading, unzip the files and move them to the ``AudioData/`` folder for your workshop repository.
