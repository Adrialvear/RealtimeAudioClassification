# Getting Set-up
Before we can get started we need to download a few things. First we need to download the project files we will use for this workshop

You can either download them directly from GitHub to your computer just follow [this link](https://github.com/DavidGoedicke/RealtimeAudioClassification) and click the download button on the right side. If you are familiar with using a command-line/terminal or git you can [clone/(fork-clone)](HowToForkHowToClone.md) the repository directly. 


## Installing software tools and libraries
Before we can use these project files, we have to install a few tools and software libraries.

1. [Install Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html). (Some might already have prepared that)
2. Start Jupyter notebooks in the folder that you cloned to with you downloaded the Git Hub Repository (i.e. in the folder you just downloaded).
3. Within Jupyter, navigate to the folder `00_Setup` and open the Notebook inside. The notebook is called `Setup.ipynb`. 
4. Follow the steps inside that notebook to install and test the software libraries we need for this workshop.

## Download datasets
For the first lab we will use [our very own Cats-Vs-Dogs](Cats-Vs-Dogs.md) dataset. We will be distributing this dataset in person directly, through [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/pgy6tn4ugbfag0j/AADuiHrW-XgbwCDqiKUrMQ6Na?dl=0), USB-stick or AirDrop. 

When these datasets are finished downloading or copying to the computer, unzip and move them to the ``AudioData/`` folder in your workshop repository folder. Any Dataset you might want to train on later should go in there to make the use of the existing scripts easy. 

For later exercise we will also use the UrbanSound dataset. You can download it here:

[Urban Sounds](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/download-urbansound.html)

Other data set can be found on [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com). Kaggle is a data science community site run by Google, which has, among other things, datasets for machine learning.
