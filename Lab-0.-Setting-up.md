## Installing tools and software
Before we can get started, we first have to install a few tools and software libraries.

1. [Install jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).
3. [Fork this git repository.](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/wiki/Forking-a-GitHub-project) ![Fork](images/HowToFork.png). [More help](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo)
4. Clone your forked version of the repository to your local computer.
5. Start Jupyter notebooks in the folder that you cloned your the forked GitHub repository (i.e. in the folder you just downloaded).
6. Within Jupyter, navigate to the folder ./00_Setup/ and open the Notebook inside. 
7. Follow the steps inside that notebook and come back to this document once you are done.
