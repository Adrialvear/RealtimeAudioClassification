# Real-time Audio classification for Musicians
(As an homage to [Tensorflow for Poets](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/#0).)

## Overview (3+1 steps)

In this workshop, we will use Jupyter notebooks, Python3, pyTorch, and Librosa to create and play with neural nets that can detect different music and different audio sources.
