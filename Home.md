# Real-time Audio classification for Musicians
(As an homage to [Tensorflow for Poets](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/#0).)

## Overview (1+3 steps)

In this workshop, we will use Jupyter notebooks, Python3, pyTorch, and Librosa to create and play with neural nets that can detect different music and different audio sources. 

For any project that you will want to use this system for, you have to go through three steps, generating the training Data, training the NeuralNet, and then Testing the NeuralNet in a realtime application. 
Before we can get started though we need to set up our environment first.
