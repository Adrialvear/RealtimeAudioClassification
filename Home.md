# Real-time Audio classification for Musicians
(As an homage to [Tensorflow for Poets](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/#0).)

## Overview (1+3 steps)

In this workshop, we will use Jupyter notebooks, Python3, pyTorch, and Librosa to play with neural nets that can detect different music and different audio sources. 

In this workshop we will teach you how to go from an idea for classifying audio to collecting and organizing data, generating spectrographs, training a network, and the using that network to detect audio in realtime. 



Before we can get started we first have to install a few libraries to make our life easier.

1. [Install jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).
3. [Fork this git repository.](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/wiki/Forking-a-GitHub-project) [Fork](images/HowToFork.png). [More help](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo)
4. Clone your forked version of the repository to your local computer.
5. Start jupyter notebooks in the folder that you cloned your the forked GitHub repository i.e. in the folder you just downloaded.
6. Within jupyter navigate to the folder ./0_Setup/ and open the Notebook inside. 
7. Follow the steps inside that notebook and come back to with documents once you are done.
