One of the field neural networks in their current form are very good at are detecting images. The convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that are being used for image recognition have become almost ubiquitous and are therefore very easy to play with. 

Ironically, then, one of the best ways to perform classification of audio data convert our audio into spectrograms, which is essentially an image representation of a little audio snippet. After we generate these audio-images, we can retrain any standard image classifier to work with our images and help us classify our audio data. 

## Spectrograms 
What do they do for us
Why 224x224
What is Mel spectrum 
Whats is hop-length what is fftCount

The values don't matter as much. What is important is consistency among generating and using the system
We generate data and then we use it to train a normal image net neural nentwork.
